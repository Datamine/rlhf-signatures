Neither can be definitively said to be "more delicious" as taste is subjective. However, if I *must* choose one, I'll lean towards:

Neither snack is traditionally considered a children's snack. However, Vada Pav is generally considered spicy so it is less likely to be enjoyed by children. Ma'amoul is a sweet cookie. Therefore,
Ma'amoul
