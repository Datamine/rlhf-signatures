Reasoning: José Rizal was a multifaceted figure - a writer, poet, doctor, and revolutionary. He played a key role in the Philippine struggle for independence from Spanish colonial rule. His life was marked by his writings, which exposed the injustices of colonial rule and inspired a sense of national identity among Filipinos. His execution at a young age cemented his status as a national hero.
